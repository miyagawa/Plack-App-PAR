NAME
    Plack::App::PAR - Run .par bundle as a PSGI application

SYNOPSIS
      % plackup -MPlack::App::PAR -e 'Plack::App::PAR->new(file => "/path/to/myapp.par")->to_app'

DESCRIPTION
    Plack::App::PAR is a Plack endpoint to run PAR bundle as a PSGI
    application.

    When you build a new PAR archive, you have to have "app.psgi" inside
    "script" directory, like:

      % pp -I lib -p -o myapp.par app.psgi

OPTIONS
    file
        The path to the PAR archive file you want to run. Required.

    script
        The name of the script inside the PAR archive. *script/app.psgi* by
        default.

TODO/BUGS
    *   There's no cleaner way to locate non-perl library files, for example
        to use for Static middleware path. File::ShareDir::PAR could be
        used.
